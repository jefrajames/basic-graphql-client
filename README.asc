This is a simple GraphQL client. It is inspired from https://github.com/ejoebstl/graphql-java-client[graphql-java-client] and has been adapted to better fit the Jakarta EE and MicroProfile ecosystem (see details below).


Its tests are based on the https://github.com/andymc12/SuperHeroDatabase[SuperHeroDatabase] project which serves  as the basis for the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-graphql[MicroProfile GraphQL] TCK.

You can use a KulmuluzEE version of the SuperHeroDatabase available on my GitHub that makes it easy to test: https://github.com/jefrajames/kumhero[kumero].

The _graphql-config.properties_ file enables to configure then GraphQL endpoint. For instance to connect to a running KumHeroDatabase instance:
----
endpoint=http://localhost:8080/graphql
----

This file also contains the text of the GraphQL queries and mutations.

What I have done is just adapting the original Simple Java GraphQL client to the MicroProfile context:

* proper use of Maven with a clean pom.xml,
* use of JSON-P and JSON-B instead of Jackson,
* raw copy of the SuperHeroDatabase model,
* basic tests using TestNG. Just 2 of them are provided for the moment. I will provide more of them later,
* external configuration of GraphQL endpoint qnd queries.

Good luck.
